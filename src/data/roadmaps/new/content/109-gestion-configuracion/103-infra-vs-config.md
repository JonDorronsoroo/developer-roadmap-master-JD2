Writing code to manage configuration, deployment, and automatic provisioning.
Managing data centers with machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration.
Ensuring all your servers and other infrastructure components are provisioned consistently and effortlessly. 
Administering cloud computing environments, also known as infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

The main difference between Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration Management (CM) is that IaC focuses on managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, while CM focuses on automating the configuration and management of software applications, operating systems, and servers.
