# Beneficios

Advantages of Continuous Testing
Here are several advantages of implementing continuous testing as a part of the software development process:
● Continuous testing enables teams to identify bugs earlier in the software development process;
● Continuous testing provides immediate feedback to developers on the quality of their code, enabling them to address any issues immediately;
● You can minimize business risks by assessing and identifying potential issues before they become real problems;
● Automating your test cases can reduce the time spent on testing;
● Accelerating the process of software delivery to production helps release the product faster;
● You can run performance tests in similitude, which can increase the speed of test execution.

## Deventajas

While continuous testing has become an integral part of the software development process, it’s not without its challenges. As software development teams work to incorporate testing into their CI/CD pipelines, they may encounter obstacles that can hinder their progress.
● Continuous testing requires a different skillset than traditional testing, including expertise in DevOps, automation and CI/CD pipelines;
● Different tools and technologies are available for continuous testing, and choosing the right ones can be tough. Integrating these tools with other parts of the development process can also be challenging;
● To fully realize the benefits of continuous testing, you need to update your testing strategy by moving away from relying solely on traditional testing methods and adopting a well-defined approach to test data management;
● Failing to integrate code regularly can result in issues such as duplicated coding efforts and non-compatible code, leading to defects.
